# Washington State Memorial Map

An interactive map showing roadside memorials across Washington State. This project visualizes locations where traffic fatalities have occurred and memorials have been placed to honor the victims.

## Features

- Interactive map of Washington State with memorial markers
- Hover over markers to see basic information
- Click on markers to zoom in and view detailed memorial information

## Technology

Built with:
- Leaflet.js for mapping
- Alpine.js for interactivity
- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no build process required, why complicate it?)

## Deployment

This site is deployed directly with netlify. 

## Data Source

The data represents roadside memorials from the Washington Department of Transportation (WDOT) memorial program, showing locations where traffic fatalities have occurred and memorials have been placed.

Special thanks to WADOT for their cooperation in providing this information. `data/WDOT Memorial Info.csv` contains a scrubbed version of data that was then populated into `memorials.json`

## Purpose

I wanted to do this because I drive past these markers all the time and I wanted to learn more about the process, the victims, and dedicate my time to something useful.
